# Simulation of Hawaii Island

## Problem statement
The overgrowing population of humans have affected the earth in many ways. This project aims to determine how the overgrowing population affects the environment,life on land, life in water, climate and geoeconomic issues like shortage of manpower, civil wars, inflation and many more.

## Scope
For simplicity and scalability, the scope of this project will be limited to the state of Hawaii, specifically the Honolulu county and the Hawaii county. For this project, we will treat the island of O'ahu and Hawaii as closed systems, i.e no external factors will be taken into account.

We will measure and compare the changes in the following parameters due to growing population.
1. Weather
2. Ocean Life
3. Carbon emissions
4. Land degradation

Future predictions will also be made for the above mentioned parameters due to growing population.

## Solution
The life 
- the simulation will be able to make economical prediction for the island of hawaii (only the hawaii island, for now)

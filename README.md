# Simulation of Hawaii Island

## Problem statement
The overgrowing population of humans have affected the earth in many ways. This project aims to determine how the overgrowing population affects the environment,life on land, life in water, climate and geoeconomic issues like shortage of manpower, civil wars, inflation and many more.

## Scope
For simplicity and scalability, the scope of this project will be limited to the state of Hawaii, specifically the island of O'ahu, the most populated island of the eight islands of hawaii with a population of 1.4 million as of July 2023. For this project, we will treat the island of O'ahu as a closed system, i.e no external factors will be taken into account.

## Solution
The life 
- the simulation will be able to make economical prediction for the island of hawaii (only the hawaii island, for now)
